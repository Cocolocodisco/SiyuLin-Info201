## Abstract
This project aims to explore the causes of wildfires in the United States as well as the reasons of increased frequency. We find this topic important because the prevalence of wildfires has increased in the past few years in the Pacific Northwest and along the West Coast, and this increase affects the quality of life among those living in said areas, and could be detrimental to people who live with respiratory problems, like asthma.

## Keywords
wildfires, quality of life, aqi, climate change

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## Chart 2: Density Map of fires in the Mainland United States
```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("../source/map_chart2.R")
chart2 <- fire_but_shades
chart2
```



### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above

```



## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
