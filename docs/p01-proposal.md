# Project Title: Wildfires in the US—Is it getting worse?!

Authors: Luis Chan, Cynthia Chang, Charlotte Lin 

Affiliation: University of Washington

Date: 31 October 2022

# Abstract: 
- This project proposal aims to explore the causes of wildfires in the United States. Over the recent years, wildfires have been extremely prevalent in the West Coast, affecting millions of  Americans' lives. To address this concern, we hope to raise awareness regarding the causes of wildfires in the United States across the span of 1992-2015.

# Introduction
- With the devastating quality of air in Seattle in October of 2022, the wildfires in the West Coast have caught our attention to the issue of climate change, wildfires and air quality. Being one of the most economically devastating natural disasters on a regular basis, we find it important to explore the reasons, causes, and trends of wildfires across the United States, regarding an array of factors such as _location_, _wind speed_, and _humidity_, among others. 

# The Problem Domain
- The rate of wildfires has increased rapidly these past few years, directly affecting the air quality which also harms quality of life for many Americans. On October 19th, 2022, Seattle had the worst air quality in the world, with West Coast cities such as ***Portland, OR*** and ***Vancouver, BC*** also being ranked as the worst cities regarding air quality in the past week. With this unprecedented situation, we would like to delve into the underlying aspects of wildfires. By knowing the history of it and its trends, we would like to raise awareness of  this issue, and with more skills and knowledge, we could predict future trends by analyzing the data.

## Direct and Indirect Stakeholders
- Direct stakeholders are the land managers and fire departments —they use the wildfire data to see which wildfires are prioritized first. This data also helps them decide how much manpower needs to be deployed and resources needed to put out the wildfires, as well as facilitate the evaluation and safety of the citizens.
- Indirect stakeholders include people who are affected by the wildfires, as well as the firefighters who are called in to fight the fires. They are not directly involved with the data, but their future work would relate to the wildfire trends. Indirect stakeholders also involved people who needed to be evacuated from the wildfires, as their quality of life was affected.

## Human Values
- Poor air quality can affect everyone, but it is especially detrimental to people who have asthma or other respiratory problems. The low vision could also be particularly dangerous to those who commute to work, and for people who spend a lot of their time outside, this could prove to be extremely harmful. 

## Potential Benefits and Harms
- The potential benefits could include less wildfires of large sizes, like the one in Seattle in mid-October of 2022. Specifically, man-made fires could be eradicated entirely. Indirect stakeholders would benefit from this, as they would be less frequently asked to evacuate from their homes, and fewer firefighters would have to risk their lives to fight high-scale wildfires. The direct stakeholders may be harmed, as they may have to shell out money to implement potential fire-preventing measures,

# Research Questions
1. How have wildfires been different in the past vs now? 
- The dataset spans from 1992 to 2015, so we can compare different factors throughout the years such as magnitude and causes of wildfires. 
- This question is important because it helps us figure out some factors of why there are more wildfires today.

2. When in the year are fires more prevalent and what are the most common causes of fire (natural vs manmade)?
- We could use the dates and durations throughout the years as well as the reasons for the wildfires.
- This question is important because we could raise awareness and advise people to be more cautious of what they do during this time of year. 

3. Why has it become a more prevalent problem now when it wasn't in the past?
- We could delve into the causes using the dataset and see if the causes are the same or are they different. We can also look at other factors, like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to see if there are any underlying factors that aren’t directly related to fires specifically. 
- This question is important because it allows us to try to figure out why it is a problem when it wasn't before, and it could be helpful to single out some reasons. 

### Provenance of Dataset
The dataset is found from Kaggle, and it is a subset from another dataset called 1.88 Million US Wildfires. 
> “This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015. It is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system.”

# Expected Implications
- If there are many man-made fires happening in the more recent years, there could be stricter implementations regarding fire hazards in campsites, for example, that could help prevent some wildfires. 
- The data spans across many regions in the United States, and this helps bring to light that the threat of the fire is not limited to the West Coast. By using this data, we could raise more awareness and encourage people to remove fire hazards and be more careful while camping, for example. 

# Limitations
- Because of the rising changes in global warming, it may be more difficult to predict wildfires just by looking at wildfire data; we would have to look at other types of global warming data as well to draw correlations. It may not be as simple as blaming man-made fires, and the temperature and humidity in our data can help address that a little bit, but it will not be able to give us the whole picture. 
- The data could not accurately describe the actual duration and discovery of fires especially for the regions that are less known to citizens, such as rural areas in the Mid-western states.
