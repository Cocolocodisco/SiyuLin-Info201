# Wildfires in the US: Is it getting worse?!

## Abstract
This project aims to, broadly speaking, explore the causes of wildfires in the United States. Over the recent years, there have been an increase in wildfires, and some of this may be due to a longer dry season and a shorter rainy season. Wildfires affect millions of Americans' lives each year, and so to
address this concern, we hope to raise awareness regarding the causes of wildfires in the United States. 

## Keywords

## Introduction
The rising issue of wildfires first caught our attetion when we experienced the devastating quality of air in Seattle in October of 2022. Wildfires are one of the most economically devastating disasters on a regular basis, so we find it important to explore the causes and trends of wildfires in the United States. We aim to explore the effects that rising temperatures and global warming has on wildfires, as well as how wildfires are started. By exploring these topics, we hope to figure out how much of the wildfires in the past were preventable, and if it is possible to prevent some wildfires in the future. 

## Problem Domain
Through this project, we hoped to explore the different reasons and causes for wildfires in the United States. Some of these reasons are directly stated in our dataset, but there are some trends and correlations that we wish to identify regarding the increased prevalence of wildfires. Apart from looking at the initial causes of wildfires from our data set, we also hope to understand what role rising temperatures (global warming and climate change) has on wildfires as well. According to an article from the World Economic Forum, it states that wildfires have gotten worse because the dry season is, on average, around 40 to 80 days longer than it has been around thirty years ago. A reason why the West Coast has been experiencing an increased amount of fires in the more recent years may be because they have not experienced many wildfires in the past. This allows vegetation to grow in large amounts, so that when a fire is inevitably started in the future, it could spread faster than a normal fire. [1] An article from iqair.com states that the number of more severe wildfires is projected to increase in the coming years. Specifically, fires around the world "will grow 14% by 2030, 30% by 2050, and 50% by 2099". [2] This article also states the wildfire smoke travels very far, which is another problem in regards to Americans' quality of life. An article from NC State University Newsroom states that in 2020, almost 18000 structures were compromised due to wildfires, to which around 54% were homes. [3] These statistics are high, and due to the rising temperatures and climate change, they will only become worse. In 2021, the average surface temperature in the United States was 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit. However, this number is expected to increase from 3 to 12 degrees by the year 2100. [3] If nothing is done regarding climate change, the fires will only become more of a problem. An article from the Smithsonian Magazine brings up the issue of man-made fires. It references a study that states that 84% of wildfires in the United States were man-made. [4] This, combined with global warming, creates a dangerous environment. We hope to raise awareness about these topics so that the number of man-made fires decrease, leading to less wildfires that can grow out of hand.

## Major Questions (Research Questions)
1. Why have wildfires become a more prevalent problem now when it was not in the past?
2. When in the year are are fires more prevalent and what are the most common causes of fires (natural vs manmade)?
3. Is the prevalence of fires correlated with global warming, specifically in the increase in therise of average temperatures?

## Dataset Information
Our main dataset is *U.S. Wildfire data (plus other attributes)*, which is a subset from another dataset (called 1.88 Million Wildfires). This dataset combines 50,000 random fire samples and historical weather data at where the fire takes place, among other details. This dataset is important because it details fires from 1992-2015, which is a large span of time that can show trends of fire activity. We also use two other datasets, one of which is also from Kaggle, while the latter is from USAFacts. The second dataset from Kaggle consists of daily temperature data from major cities around the world, from 1995-2020. Prior to using this dataset, we shaved down the dataset to just cities in the United States. Our third dataset has information of acres burned in wildfires, and this dataset lets us analyze how much land has been burned from the years 1983 to 2021, as well as the initial cause of the fire.
