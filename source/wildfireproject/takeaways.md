### Takeaway #1:

Our first major takeaway is man-made fires dominate the board for the most man-made fires in the years 1992-2015. Originally, we were curious as to whether it was natural fires or man-made fires that were causing the increase in fires, especially since due to climate change, many natural disasters are becoming more severe. But in the end, man-made fires are still a major problem, (with debris burning and arson topping the charts for the top ten wildfires in the United States) and in order to prevent wildfires in the future, steps must be taken, either through regulations that make debris burning and arson more discouraged, or through raising awareness through campaigns and the like.

### Takeaway #2:

Our second major takeaway is that global warming is correlated with the increase in wildfires. As we can see in the interactive map, many of the wildfires happen in places like California, Texas, Florida, and other Southern states, which often have a higher average temperature than places like Washington or Michigan, for example. Because of the rising average temperatures, this leaves the United States with a longer dry season each year, and with lower rainfall in these dry seasons, small fires tend to grow into wildfires faster than if it were started outside of the dry season. From the data, we can estimate that fire season can start anytime as early as March and end near late August/early September.

### Takeaway #3:

Our third takeaway is that, unlike what we originally thought, which is that wildfires have only increased in the more recent years because of more man-made fires, debris burning has consistently been the number one reason for wildfires in the United States (from 1992-2015). With the exception of a couple years of arson becoming number one, (which is also classified as a man-made fire,) we can see that in general, the initial causes of fire is not a really big factor in the increase of wildfires. We think that it's more of a combination of global warming/climate change and the man-made fire factor that may be one of few factors that contribute to the increased prevalence of wildfires.
