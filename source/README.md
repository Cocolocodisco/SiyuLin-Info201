# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[chart2_map](./chart2_map) | This is the source code for a density map of the United States that depicts the number of wildfires in each state from 1992-2015 (in a random sample of 50,000).
|[Chart 3](./Chart 3.R) | This is the source code for a scatterplot matrix of the average yearly temperature of every state in the United States, as well as additional territories. 

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them in the table above
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
